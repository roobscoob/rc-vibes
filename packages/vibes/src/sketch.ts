// sketch({ color: look }).
//
// The switch look is asked about the old bulbs only, which just switch: true or
// false, a number (on at 0.5 or more, as arclamp's own `on` channel), "on" or
// "off", or a function of here (a field too) giving one. Without one, the old
// bulbs are left as they are; a color never switches them.
//
// Null or undefined from either leaves the light as it is below (so does
// false from a color look). Something that can't be read leaves it as it is
// too, with a warning (once for each kind of mistake), so one slip doesn't
// stop the sketch.
