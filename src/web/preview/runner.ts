// A sketch's own preview: the sketch in its own worker, on its own clock,
// making its own frames for the map it's drawn on (it's a FrameSource), and
// keeping what it logs for the console. It runs in the preview panel of the
// sketch's VS Code (main.tsx), and touches nothing else: not the room, and
// not any other preview.
//
// Its clock runs from when it was (re)started, less any pauses, and each
// frame's time is what update() gets, as both nowMs and initialMs: arclamp
// gives every layer of a frame that frame's time as initialMs (the room tone
// stamps each tick), so a sketch counting from initialMs to nowMs sees
// almost nothing go by, here as in the room. Time since it started is the
// sketch's own to keep, from the first initialMs it sees.
//
// Pausing stops calling update(), and the clock with it, so playing again
// picks up where it was. Restarting loads the sketch afresh, top-level state
// and all, on a new clock. Swapping in a new build of it does too, but keeps
// the clock: the preview carries on from where it was, running the new code. A sketch run as its
// modules is updated in place instead, by Vite's HMR (hmr() hands the
// worker what the box's Vite sends; onHmr, what the worker sends back).
// Each tick, update() gets every light at rest (every channel 0: nothing under
// it, as if it were all that's running), and its output is merged over that
// as arclamp merges. An update() that throws, or takes too long, stops the
// preview, with why in the console.
