// Pending edits: changes made in vibes that haven't been applied to the room:
// this page's layer over its copy of the live state (scene.ts). While there
// are any, vibes is in simulated mode: the map shows what the room would do
// with them (sim.ts), Apply sends them as one update, and Discard throws them
// away. In live mode, they're sent as they're made. Either way they stay here,
// shown over the copy, until vibes says it's made them. Each browser has its
// own; others keep seeing the live room.
//
// A draft records only what you changed, on top of whatever is live, so
// changes others make meanwhile still show through: room tone, each shader's
// mute, mask, home, params and place in the stack, the shaders taken out of it, and
// the sketches being put in (each on its home, previewed once built, with a
// pool of its own for its params, which goes in with it). A shader on its way
// in, or one you're adding, is switched and moved like any other: vibes puts
// it in that way. It knows shaders by vibes' keys; which shader in arclamp
// each is, only vibes' server knows.
