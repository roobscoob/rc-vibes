// A color editor, for one light's color or many at once. Values at exactly
// the same color are one circle on a color wheel (or a square of whites):
// with one color among the lights, one big circle; with several, a small one
// each, so the picker shows the whole range of them. Pressing the picker
// anywhere takes every light to that color (on a circle, exactly its color),
// and dragging takes them all along. The keys step each color from where it
// is. Brightness and fidelity are a knob with every light at one value, or a
// range from the lowest to the highest, whose ends clamp the lights they pass
// (Slider.tsx). Where the values come from, and where a change goes, is up
// to whoever uses it.
//
// The wheel is OKLCh at L = 1, the canonical Lemtone plane: hue goes round,
// chroma goes out from white, as far as the bulbs' bluest blue (wheel.ts).
// Brightness is absolute (1.0 = 1000 lm) on a cube-root track, roughly how
// bright it looks, so the dim end, where saturated colors live, gets room. The
// track tops out at the lights' rated output: 1000 lm for color bulbs,
// 4000 lm for 4×1 panels (the brighter, if they're mixed).
// Where the lights, each at its own brightness, can't make colors as asked,
// the wheel and the strip show what they make instead, striped, bordered
// round what they can. With both kinds of light among them (color bulbs and
// panels each make their own), there are two edges: round what at least one
// of them makes as asked (bordered), and, dotted, round what every one does;
// and the stripes are of what the least capable of them makes and of what
// the most capable does. A circle asked for there sits where its lights land,
// in their color (one for each kind of light, which each land somewhere of
// their own), with a ghost of it where it's asked for. Circles whose lights
// land in the same spot are one circle there, counting them all. Under the
// pointer, a ball (or a ghost) says its color (hue and chroma on the wheel,
// temperature and tint on the whites), and, where the lights fall short,
// what each kind of them makes of it instead.
