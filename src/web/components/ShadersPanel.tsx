// The layers in the room (its shaders), in a panel along the left of the
// map: the bottom of the stack first, as the selection's rows read (each
// draws over what's above it), dragged by their grips to reorder the
// stack, on the same rail as the selection's: a stop each, in the light it
// makes on its lights (hollow while it's off, or not in yet). Last on the
// rail, the library (AddSketch.tsx): adding another, on the lights selected
// (every light, with none). The
// library also opens from the code button in the panel's head.
//
// Under its name, how many lights it's on; after it, with
// changes to it not saved yet, its own pink asterisk (as the selection's
// title has for the whole room's), which selects the lights they change on
// this floor. Clicking a layer
// selects the lights it's on (on this floor; shift adds them, or, all of
// them selected already, lets go of them; alt lets go of them, or, none of
// them selected, adds them), or, on none
// here, lets go of the selection, and does nothing else (the map stays put);
// under the pointer, its lights are ringed, dashed, on the map (hint.ts, as
// its asterisk's are). Every row is open, always: under it, the lights it's
// on, each kind on a line in their colors (LightsSummary.tsx, as the map's
// tooltip says them), and what can be done to it: opening its
// code, editing its domain on the map (layer-mode.ts: the map becomes a shader
// selector), cloning it, updating it, and deleting it (or keeping it, once
// it's going).
