// The preview: what the room would do with your pending edits, run in the
// browser. Room tone from the draft's template, then each shader in stack
// order, bottom first, each in its own worker (sim.worker.ts), merged as
// arclamp merges: a shader's channels override the layer below, anything it
// leaves out stays as it was, values that aren't finite numbers are dropped,
// and on the lights it's masked from its output is its input (a muted
// shader is masked from every light). It also notes which lights each shader
// is trying to change, before its mask or mute, as arclamp does for the live
// room (useLayerEffects; the selection panel lists them).
//
// It differs from arclamp in running ~30 times a second rather than 100, on
// the browser's JS engine, with browser rules for fetch (CORS), and without
// udp. A shader's params, pending edits and all, are handed to it as vibes'
// stream hands them over in the room. What a sketch being added declares, its
// preview here says (drafts.declared), so its knobs are there before it's in.
// Its frames are in arclamp's time, as this page reckons it (rtime.ts), and
// each shader has the show clock, so a sketch's beat here is the room's.
