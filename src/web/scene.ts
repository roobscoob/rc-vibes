// missed), and this page's updates to it (sendUpdate), each answered once the

// as they come. From the tree, the room as the page shows it (useScene: the
// stack of shaders, top first, the room tone, and the pools) and the lights'

// each shader's is); the preview needs them to run pending edits, so they're
// fetched once each, by hash, and put back. And the show (useShowOn,
// useShowClock, sendTransport), with arclamp's time to read its clock by,
// asked of vibes on the same socket (rtime.ts).
