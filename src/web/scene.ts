// The room socket (/api/scene/ws; shared/live.ts): this page's copy of the
// live state, kept as vibes sends it (the whole tree, then each change, each
// numbered: a page that reconnects says the last it had, and gets what it
// missed), and this page's updates to it (sendUpdate), each answered once the
// tree shows it. From the tree, the room as the page shows it (useScene: the
// stack of shaders, top first, the room tone, and the pools) and the lights'
// layout (useLayout). The tree leaves scripts out (scriptHash says which
// each shader's is); the preview needs them to run pending edits, so they're
// fetched once each, by hash, and put back. The show rides the same socket,
// beside the tree: its clock both ways (show.ts), its scenes (show-scenes.ts),
// and a scene fired, answered as an update is.
