// The room, as vibes has it, for the live state (live.ts: its scene part,
// which every page has): the stack of shaders as vibes has them (Shader, in
// shared/vibes.ts), top first, and the room tone; made again whenever it may
// be different, and handed on (subscribe). It's made from arclamp's scene,
// followed as it changes (/v1/scene/events: the whole scene to start, then
// each shader as it's added or changes, and each one removed), each shader
// with its sketch (by its stamp), footprint and instance; and the instances
// not in arclamp yet, on their way in (or that couldn't go in), each where
// it's to go in: just above the shader it's to be above, or on top.
// Each shader has vibes' key (shader-keys.ts), never arclamp's id. Scripts
// are left out, as arclamp's events leave them out, saying which by hash:
// vibes fetches each new one once, for its stamp and for the preview (which
// fetches the ones it needs, by hash: /api/scene/scripts). So it's small.
//
// What vibes changes in the scene itself (through noting(arclamp), which
// every route writes through) is shown at once, to every browser, as it's
// made: arclamp only looks for changes to send ten times a second, so its
// event comes up to a tenth of a second later. When it does, it has the last
// word. A shader shown changed that no event confirms (a move arclamp made
// differently, with someone else moving shaders at once) is asked after.
//
// A footprint is every light a shader has changed since its script last did,
// before its mask or mute: where its code lights. Each frame of the light
// stream says what every shader's latest render changed (its touched
// section: touched(), from the relay). The union is kept, in the database
// (written at most once a second), and starts again with each new script.
//
// A shader's instance (and footprint) goes with it: when arclamp says it's
// removed, or when it's missing from the whole scene and arclamp, asked,
// says there's no such shader (rather than one too new to be in it).
