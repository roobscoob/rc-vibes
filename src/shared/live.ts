// The live state: everything vibes has of the room that a page shows or
// changes, as one tree of values (LiveTree), each at a path ("roomtone/24/
// brightness"). vibes holds it; each page keeps a copy, kept in step by the
// room socket (/api/scene/ws): the whole tree to start (state), then each
// change as it's made (delta), numbered (rev), so a page that reconnects
// says the last it had and gets what it missed.
//
// A page changes it by sending an update: some ops, each a path and its new
// value, or just a path to take it away. vibes checks all of an update before
// making any of it, makes it (each area of the tree in its own way: room tone
// and the stack in arclamp, params in their pools, the layout in vibes'
// database), and says it's done once the tree shows it. Last write wins, path
// by path. What a page has changed and vibes hasn't shown yet, the page shows
// over its copy meanwhile (its draft: web/draft.ts).
//
// The paths a page can change (anything else is vibes' own to say):
//
//   roomtone/<light>/<channel>        a number
//   shaders/<key>                     taken away: out of the room
//   shaders/<+key>                    AddSpec: a sketch put in, under its pending edit's key
//   shaders/<key>/muted               true or false
//   shaders/<key>/mask                the lights it may not change
//   shaders/<key>/instance/home       the lights it was put on (an instance's)
//   stack                             every shader's key, top first
//   pools/<pool>/declared             ParamSpec[], by whoever runs its code
//   pools/<pool>/values/<param>/<light>  a value; taken away, back to the default
//   layout/lights/<light>/spot        Spot, or null: off the map
//   layout/lights/<light>/type        another orientation (an arclamp type)
//   layout/lights/<light>/tags        its whole set of tags
//   layout/rails/<rail>               RailShape, or null: taken away
//
// Nothing is an array but a value: paths only go through objects.
